# REST API CLIENT
# WeatherApp

## Overview
WeatherApp is a Java-based console application that fetches and displays current weather information for a given city using the OpenWeatherMap API.

## Features
- Fetch current weather details for a specified city.
- Display temperature, "feels like" temperature, humidity, and weather description.
- Built-in error handling for invalid API responses or network issues.

## Objectives
- To demonstrate the use of APIs in Java.
- To learn about parsing JSON responses using the Gson library.
- To practice working with HTTP requests in Java.

## Technology Used
- **Programming Language**: Java
- **API**: OpenWeatherMap API
- **Libraries**:
  - Gson (for JSON parsing)
  - Java Standard Library (for HTTP connections and input/output)

## How It Works
1. The application makes an HTTP GET request to the OpenWeatherMap API.
2. The JSON response from the API is parsed to extract weather details.
3. Weather details are displayed in a user-friendly format on the console.

## Setup Instructions
1. Obtain an API key from OpenWeatherMap: https://openweathermap.org/api.
2. Clone the project or copy the code into a Java IDE.
3. Replace the `API_KEY` variable with your OpenWeatherMap API key.
4. Run the program to get the weather information for a specific city.
